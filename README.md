# Smart Home Control System  

## Description  
The **Smart Home Control System** is a prototype mobile-based application integrated with a TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller to provide users with efficient control and monitoring of home appliances. This system ensures convenience and safety by offering real-time monitoring, appliance control, and alert mechanisms.  

## Features  
1. **Lamp Control**  
   - Turn a 220V lamp ON/OFF via the mobile application while retaining manual switch functionality.  

2. **Plug Control**  
   - Remotely enable/disable a plug to restrict usage when turned off.  

3. **Door Monitoring**  
   - Display door status (open/closed) using a magnetic switch sensor.  

4. **Temperature Monitoring**  
   - Display the current room temperature on the mobile application.  

5. **Temperature Alarm**  
   - Trigger a software-based and physical alarm when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.  

6. **Door Activity Logging**  
   - Save and display timestamps for door openings and closings.  

## Hardware Requirements  
- TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller board  
- Magnetic door switch  
- Temperature sensor (LM35)  
- 220V lamp with manual switch  
- Plug and relay module  
- Alarm module (buzzer)  
- Power supply and connecting wires  
- Mounted prototype surface
